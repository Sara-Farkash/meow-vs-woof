## 🚀 How to Run

1. Install the required packages:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt


Train the model:
python catdog_classifier_train.py
Make a prediction on a new image:
python prediction.py
View training graphs:
python graph_drawing.py

# 📸 Example Prediction
After training, you can add an image inside the predict/ folder named my_test_image.jpg, and run the prediction script to see whether it's a cat or a dog 🐾
